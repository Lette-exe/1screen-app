# XCode Single View App Template
Apple seems to have gotten rid of this template in XCode. Most of the online tutorials (including their own) still use it,
so for people looking for this template, you can use this one. It has only the Unit Tests checkbox included from the new project settings,
so if you need the files for Core Data and UI Tests, you'll have to get those elsewhere.
